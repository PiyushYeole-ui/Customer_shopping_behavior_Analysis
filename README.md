# 🛒 Customer Shopping Behavior Intelligence End-to-End Retail Data Analysis using SQL, Python & BI Tools

# 👨🏻‍💻 Project Overview  

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow focused on analyzing retail customer shopping behavior. The objective is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence using SQL, Python, and visualization tools.

The project simulates real-world responsibilities of a Data Analyst working in retail or e-commerce environments

# 🎯 Business Objective
Retail businesses need answers to critical questions:

  Which products truly drive revenue?

  Do discounts increase profitability or just order volume?

  Which customer segments generate the most value?

  What are the most preferred product categories?

  How do ratings correlate with sales performance?

This project addresses these business problems using structured analytical techniques.

# 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains transactional-level retail customer purchase data. Each row represents an individual customer transaction, capturing product details, purchase behavior, and transaction attributes.

# 🔹 Data Structure
Customer ID

Product Category

Item Purchased

Purchase Amount

Review Rating

Discount Applied

Shipping Type

Each record represents a customer transaction.

# 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

SQL (Advanced Queries, Aggregation, Conditional Logic, Subqueries)

Python (Pandas for Data Cleaning & Validation)

Jupyter Notebook

Git & GitHub

# 🔄 End-to-End Workflow

**📊 Key Insights**

  High sales volume does not always equal high revenue.
  
  Certain categories dominate transaction frequency.
  
  Discounted transactions increase order count but may impact average order value.
  
  Rating score is not always directly proportional to revenue generation.
  
  Shipping preference patterns indicate customer cost sensitivity.
